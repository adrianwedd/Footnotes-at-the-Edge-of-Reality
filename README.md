## About

This repository holds a poem and its exegesis.

The poem is written to be experienced without explanation.
The exegesis exists for those who want to trace the ideas behind it.

The two texts are written in different grammars.

## The Site

The site is built for reading.

Dark-first typography. Long-form comfort.
A background that shows curvature through field lines—streamlines flowing from edges toward an invisible centre, fading before arrival.

The background exists to suggest continuation, not to impress.
If you notice it immediately, it has failed.

---

## Development

```bash
cd site
npm install
npm run dev
```

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Charter

This is a text-first work.
The background exists to suggest continuation, not to impress.

See [DESIGN_CHARTER.md](DESIGN_CHARTER.md) for the full intent.
