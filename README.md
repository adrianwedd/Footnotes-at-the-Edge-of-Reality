# Footnotes at the Edge of Reality

This repository contains a poem ([poem.md](poem.md)) and an accompanying exegesis ([exegesis.md](exegesis.md)).

The poem is written to be experienced without explanation.  
The exegesis exists for readers who want to trace the physical and philosophical ideas the poem leans on.

The two texts are written in different grammars.
